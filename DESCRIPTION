Title: Stack and Reshape Datasets After Splitting Concatenated Values
Version: 1.4.8
Date: 2019-04-21
Author: Ananda Mahto

Description: Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export
    multiple-response questions with data concatenated in cells. The
    concat.split (cSplit) family of functions splits such data into separate 
    cells. The package also includes functions to stack groups of columns and 
    to reshape wide data, even when the data are "unbalanced"---something 
    which reshape (from base R) does not handle, and which melt and dcast from 
    reshape2 do not easily handle.
